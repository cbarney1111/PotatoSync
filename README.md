# PotatoSync
A super simple app to recursively sync windows directory to phone - great for moving large amounts of files.

I grew tired of trying to move hundreds of GBs of Music around to various devices using existing windows CnP/DnD as it is horrible with large amounts of files. Using any commerical syncs apps is not something I wanted to do either.

Only files that do not exist will be copied.

App uses: https://github.com/Bassman2/MediaDevices v1.8.0

Usage: PotatoSync \ " Example: PotatoSync c:\Music\Flac \Phone\Music\Flac\ "Galaxy Note9"
